# PerZeption ðŸ‘€

Perzeption aims to make comprehensive eye exams accessible via the internet. Currently, the company has built their exam prototype through MatLab and it is only available in their clinical studies. However, our prototype this semester will bring their primary exam, Find, to the web so that those interested can learn more about the company and its planned offerings. 

Programmed using VueJS
