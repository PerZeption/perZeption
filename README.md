# PerZeption ðŸ‘€

https://perzeption.github.io

Perzeption aims to make comprehensive eye exams accessible via the internet. Currently, the company has built their exam prototype through MatLab and it is only available in their clinical studies. However, our prototype this semester will bring their primary exam, Find, to the web so that those interested can learn more about the company and its planned offerings. 

Programmed using [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/)

Based from: [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/LJe2Ing516HcS5neKuVSBU/Homepage-Ideation?node-id=987%3A1126&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=708%3A1390&starting-point-node-id=987%3A1126&show-proto-sidebar=1)

## Understanding the Code Directory

Within the `src` folder, there are a few folders which will contain the files which make up the PerZeption website. 
- `assets` -- the assets folder will contain any images/ visuals you will need to incorporate into the website.
- `components` -- the components folder contains basic components which are included on multiple parts of the page, such as buttons, navigation, expandables, etc.
- `router` -- the router folder contains the file which contains the sublinks to different pages within the website (e.a. https://perzeption.github.io/about).
- `sections` -- the sections folder contains the different sections within a page (e.a. the home page contains a title section, demo section, product section, etc.).
- `styles` -- the styles folder contaisn style sheets which help the pages look nice, crucial for the aesthetic portion of the website. 

Each single file Vue component will be layed out as
```
<template>
    <!--contains all of the HTML elements -->
</template>

<script>
    <!--contains all of the JavaScript functions -->
</script>

<style>
    <!--contains all of the CSS styling -->
</style>
```
